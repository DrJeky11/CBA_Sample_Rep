The Mission Planning Tools section of this publication is the detailed source for mission planning. The Mission Planning Tools table assumes a 6-hour rapid planning time line, but can be applied to larger scope missions as well, according to any mission time line.PROCEDURES FOR MISSION PLANNING1. At the receipt of an initiating directive, mission, or warning order, all squadron planners report to the ready room. Key players (AMC, AFL, EFL, AFC, etc.) form in an area sufficiently isolated to allow focus on problem framing. Key players must remain co-located in order to facilitate integration of all mission assets. Problem framing is conducted in accordance with (IAW) the Marine Corps Planning Process (MCPP).2. While key players analyze the mission, the mission XO briefs squadron planners on available information and outlines the Courses of Action (COA) to be developed. Additionally, time / space analysis needs to be conducted in order to inform the COAs.3. Key players and planning representatives are outlined in the list below. Detailed planners / coordinators that assist in functional areas are listed underneath. Based on the situation, mission, and number of the planners available, some planners may be assigned to coordinate more than one task.NOTEThe Mission Planning Tools tab lists mission planning tasks and time line.A.
