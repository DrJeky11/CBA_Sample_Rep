because the PET monitors the status of all the MTFs in theater in order to match type of injury to medical specialty of each facility, as well as to ensure that bed space is available. The PET is also responsible for maintaining accountability of patient movement until the casualty is dropped off at an appropriate MTF. The bottom line is that the PET, via the DASC, ensures the casualty reaches the appropriate role of care in the timeliest manner possible.
