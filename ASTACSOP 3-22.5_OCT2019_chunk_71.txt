RV remains on deck or in a hover during the recovery. Upon landing in the LZ, minimal members (recommend a fire-team–sized element) of the TRAP force exit the RV and move toward the survivor’s location. Used when insertion of the TRAP force IVO isolated personnel is possible and to minimize its time on deck. (2) “FLY AWAY” — The RV lands, insert the TRAP force and then depart the zone to an HA until called back in for extract. Used when threat prevents the RV from laagering on deck or the TRAP force requires extensive time on deck to move, stabilize, and transport the isolated personnel to the LZ, and the RV determines an airborne hold is advantageous. The TRAP force should maintain security of the LZ during the recovery, if able.(3) “OFFSET” — The RV inserts the TRAP force displaced from the IP’s location. The TRAP force then moves overland to the objective area and coordinates with the RV when extraction is required. Used when the situation precludes aircraft inserting the TRAP force directly to the IP’s location. UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 153TRAPNTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUONOTEIf special equipment, such as Rope Insertion and Extraction (RIE) equipment or hoist is required to insert the TRAP force to the IP location, consider planning for an alternate LZ for extract.C. When all players have the correct PR 15-line and game plan, the RMC push all players in the objective area to a common net such as SAR A to execute the recovery. The RMC shall positively check-in all players on the objective area common net. Once all players are checked in, the RMC shall state “EXECUTE, EXECUTE, EXECUTE.” D. RV shall report “IP INBOUND.” Prior to entering the ROZ, all aircraft shall be at the contract altitudes.E. RESCORT shall respond “CONTINUE, LZ CHERRY/ICE, ESTABLISHED [position or BP].”F. RV shall report “5 MILES,” “3 MILES” and “1 MILE” to provide time and space information to the RMC/RESCORT. Specific TTPs to use this information are used across the various services for triggers in recovery execution.G. RV shall report “VISUAL [Callsign / “OBJECTIVE”/ “JACK”]” with isolated personnel in sight. This signals that the RV now has control of the isolated personnel and assumes primary communication with them on the radio. If not visual with the isolated personnel, the RV can report “VISUAL ZONE.” H. When clear of the RV, the TRAP force should check-in with the RMC/RESCORT on the objective area common net.(1) Upon landing in the LZ, RMC/RESCORT should relay to the TRAP force the direction and distance of the survivor from the RV via clock code and distance in meters if the RV does not report “VISUAL [Callsign / “OBJECTIVE”/ “JACK”]” I. RV shall pass “30 SECONDS” prior to lifting to allow RESCORT time to finish attacks in progress and clear egress route. If the egress has changed since last passed in the PR 15-line, the RMC shall pass egress instructions.J. RV shall pass “POPCORN + X” when lifting, with X being the number of
