should be prepared to respond to an authentication request in return.2. Training AKAC / AKAL . An unclassified AKAC / AKAL is contained in the Airborne Matrix and Cipher / Authentication sections of this publication for training and exercise use. This AKAC / AKAL shall not be used for contingency or combat operations.3. Enciphering and Authentication Standards :A. Authentication / enciphering does not apply to secure nets. However, if an interloper is suspected on a secure net, that agency should be authenticated.B. Each station is afforded two opportunities to correctly respond to authentication before initiating the “GINGERBREAD” procedures.C. Unusual delays of an authentication challenge should cause the originator to initiate “GINGERBREAD” procedures.D. Never encipher more than 10 digits on one set line.E. Never transmit numbers in the clear after enciphering them.NTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 108 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUOF. Authenticate upon initial contact on a clear net; anyone may challenge an agency whenever it is deemed necessary.G. Never transmit the letter of the set line.H. Add zeros periodically to confuse the enemy when encrypting single numbers (e.g., for the number 5, encrypt and send 005).GINGERBREAD PROCEDURESEach station is afforded two opportunities to correctly respond to authentication before initiating the GINGERBREAD procedures. If an operator on a net is unreliable, passes suspect information, or does not properly authenticate, the operator is marked as GINGERBREAD followed by the call sign. The status of the GINGERBREAD net is passed to AC2 via an In-Flight Report (IFREP).CHATTERMARKA chattermark plan should consist of three frequencies that use different waveforms (HAVE QUICK, SINCGARS) and different bands of the frequency spectrum (UHF, VHF). If communication jamming (or other form of MIJI) is recognized, execute the following:Discussion should be had on who the net owner is, authorities, and positively communicating how it changes if required. Example scenario EFL – JTAC TAD. Venom 11 is acting as EFL conducting detached ESCORT in the OBJ area prior to insert of the assault force. At this point the EFL is the net owner of the TAD net. Once the assault force is inserted, and the BHO occurs between the EFL and the JTAC, TAD net ownership would transfer to the JTAC with the BHO, or IAW the briefed transition.1. The chattermark plan is initiated on the affected working frequency by whoever is the net owner with “chattermark x 3” and prowords “KICK” or “Push” as required. The first change is to freq 2, followed by freq 3, followed by freq 1. For example, if EMI is encountered on freq 1, kick to freq 2. If EMI is encountered on freq 2, kick to freq 3. If EMI is again encountered on freq 3, kick back to freq 1.Freq 1: HAVEQUICK A00.025Freq 2: SINCGARS F196Freq 3: UHF 301.02. Procedures to counter EMI:A. Terrain mask to avoid line of sight with the jammer.B. Tighten up the flight to burn through the jamming signal.C. Execute the chattermark plan; the net owner announces “CHATTERMARK x 3” or the prowords “KICK/PUSH” and new frequency. Example: “CHATTERMARK CHATTERMARK CHATTERMARK
