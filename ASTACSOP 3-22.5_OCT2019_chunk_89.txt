to the row indicated by the first letter of the random set indicator (rows are indicated by the far left single column of letters in bold print).3. Read right on that row and locate the second letter of the random set indicator. Take the letter immediately to the right of that second letter and go to that row.NOTEIf directed to go to a letter immediately to the right of the last letter in a row, go back to the first letter of the same row.4. On this new row, read right and locate the third letter of the random set indicator. Identify the letter to the RIGHT of that third letter. That letter will be the row indicator which identifies the encipher row. This row will be used to encipher or decipher the message.EXAMPLEStep 1 .

From there, go to the second letter of in the set indicator “X”. The letter to the RIGHT of this letter takes us to the next row “D”. We then go to the third letter of the set indicator “F”. The letter to the RIGHT of this letter identifies our encipher/decipher row, in this case, “E”To encipher grid zone designators . Using the encipher row and the bold guide alphabet rows, read right on the nearest guide row until you find the first Grid Zone Designator (GZD) letter to be enciphered. For the plain text letter, substitute the letter located above or below it on the encipher row. Repeat for second GZD letter.EXAMPLEIf your line indicator is “E,” the grid zone designator “DT” would be enciphered as “KI.”Plain text Plain textPlain text alphabetABCDEFG HIJ KLM NO PQR ST UV WX YZ E QZTK PHW OVA YES NU RXB FI CM GJ LDCipher text Cipher text UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 195NTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUOAUTHEN MATRIXTo encipher numbers . Using the encipher line, read right and find the numbered column that corresponds to the first digit of the numbers to be enciphered. Substitute one of the letters in that column for the plain text number. Stay on this line and repeat this process for each digit to be enciphered.NOTEEach column has from two to four letters listed for each number. These letters are called “variants” and should be chosen at random. Each variant from a column should be used before any letter is reused.EXAMPLEIf your row indicator is “E,” You could encipher the numbers “135” as “PSX” or “HYB” 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9E QZTK PHW OVA YES NU RXB FI CM GJ LD Row IndicatorTo transmit .
