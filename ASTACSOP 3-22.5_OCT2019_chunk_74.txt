are by example; planners should set the distance based on capability.NOTE:(1) Overwater recoveries should be a Navy-led effort. The MAGTF commander may employ USMC assets to assist the Navy efforts.(2) Consider the role of the UH-1Y as the RESCORT and/or RV, depending on lift requirements and configuration.

It should inform the mission commander’s decision to launch a TRAP package with an assessment of risk, but should not be the sole basis for making a TRAP launch decision. Below is an example of how a TRAP decision matrix can be built to aid the commander in determining the best match of assets and tactics to the potential threat.EXAMPLE TRAP DECISION MATRIXRECON/SOFCLANDESTINEGROUNDEXTRACTACE/GCETERF/NVG/RSEADACE/GCETERF/NVGACE/GCE/LSESTD TERFACE/GCEMED TO HIGH DENSITYADA / IR & RDR SAMSLIGHT DENSITYADA/IR SAMSSMALL ARMSSAFE OVERLANDSAFE OVERWATERBLUEGREENYELLOWREDBLACK12345/6TRAPZONES THREATTACTICSASSETSUNFAVORABLEFAVORABLENTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 158 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUOTHIS PAGE IS INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 159NTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUOCASEVACCASUALTY EVACUATION CASEVACGENERALCASEVAC is the unregulated movement of casualties that can include movement both to and between medical treatment facilities. Proper CASEVAC planning enables the MAGTF commander to evacuate the casualty to the proper Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) within a specified amount of time. The primary references governing CASEVAC procedures are listed below.1. JP 4-02, Joint Health Services2. MCRP 3-16.6A JFIRE3. JP 1-02 DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms4. MCRP 3-40A.7 Patient MovementCASUALTY CLASSIFICATIONSCasualties will be classified by the on-scene medical attendant. That classification must be honored until the patient’s arrival at the destination MTF. The aircraft commander cannot downgrade the classification; however, anyone can upgrade a casualty, if warranted. 1. Urgent : Patients requiring emergency, short-notice evacuation (within a maximum of one hour) to save life, limb, or eyesight and to prevent serious complications of the injury, serious illness, or permanent disability.A. Urgent Surgical : Patients requiring forward resuscitative care for life- and limb-saving measures, and to attain stabilization for further evacuation within a maximum one hour.2. Priority : Patients requiring prompt evacuation within a maximum of four hours to prevent the medical condition from deteriorating to an URGENT precedence or to prevent unnecessary pain or disability, or who require treatment not available locally.3. Routine : Patients who do not require immediate medical attention and whose condition is not expected to deteriorate significantly. They should be evacuated within 24 hours.4. Convenience : Patients for whom evacuation by medical vehicle is a matter of medical convenience rather than necessity.PATIENT EVACUATION TEAM (PET)The PET is composed of up to eight Navy personnel from the medical battalion and has two officers from a Navy medical department, medical corps, or nurse corps who are trained in medical regulating. The PET co-locates with the DASC with the primary function of coordinating the execution of immediate CASEVAC missions.The PET’s role and responsibility is to recommend an evacuation mode (air or ground), platform, and destination for all casualties. The latter is important
