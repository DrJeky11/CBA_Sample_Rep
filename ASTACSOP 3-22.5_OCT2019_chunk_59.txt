The EFL would brief: “Cherry criteria for LZ Dodo is mechanized infantry within 1800 meters and /or an unsuppressed ZPU within 1500m of the zone.” NOTE The MCRP 3-30B.1 (ALSA Brevity MTTP) defines ICE / CHERRY as the absence or presence of enemy activity at the LZ that is below or above the pre-briefed risk tolerance of the Ground Force Commander (GFC). During MAGTF air assault operations, the Mission Commander (MC) will take into account the threat to the assault force as well as aviation assets when determining risk tolerance with regard to LZ status. OBJECTIVE AREA INTEGRATION AND DE-CONFLICTION1. Integration . The goal of objective area planning is the integration of all assets and their fires.2. De-confliction . The three methods of de-confliction in the objective area are time, lateral distance, and altitude. Mission planners should strive to establish two of the three de-confliction measures when planning an objective area. A. Altitude stack in OBJ Area (V-Diagram)(1) Based on the objective area threat to RW / TR aircraft, altitude de-confliction may not be advisable. In this case lateral and time separation should be used. Once visual contact is established, escorts may maneuver as required to conduct attached / detached / shuttle escort tactics. (2) If an overhead pattern is used, escorts will maintain a minimum of 200 feet above assault ingress / egress altitude until visual contact with the assault flight is established. Once visual contact is established, escorts may maneuver as required to conduct attached / detached / shuttle escort tactics.OBJECTIVE AREA ACCOUNTABILITYA. The standard for reporting accountability to the MC / AMC / AFC is using the ASSAT serial number for insert to the LZ and PAX number on extract from the LZ. If performing a contingency or other unplanned insert / extract (e.g., no ASSAT), PAX number is the primary method.B. The standard for reporting accountability to the EFL / escorts is using the PAX number for insert / extract from the LZ. This will enable the EFL / escorts to track PAX accountability in and out of the objective area. IAW mandatory objective area communications, the EFL / escorts may request amplifying information (e.g., ASSAT serials). 1. Objective area communication. The AMC and subordinate flight leaders must plan and brief objective area communication to include priority of comms (e.g., CAS comms versus IP inbound calls). In general, the standard calls listed in the table are made on TAD if a terminal controller is in the objective area. If no terminal controller is present, these calls are made on a pre-arranged common net. Amplifying information if “with exceptions” is passed by the AFL may be passed over a separate net, like EFL or AFL common per mission planning. In many cases terminal controllers want to know exceptions passed by the AFL and the TAD NET may be the appropriate venue for this information.
