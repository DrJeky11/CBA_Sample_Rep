General . The intent of check-in is for each element or flight to check the capabilities of each aircraft’s radios across multiple frequency bands, including the ability to frequency-hop via active communications. Accordingly, flight or element leaders should design the check-in in a manner that checks each aircraft’s radios ability to communicate in the UHF and VHF frequency bands, both plain and secure. The ability to communicate on HAVEQUICK and SINCGARS should also be checked. To avoid confusion in the cockpit during the check-in, radios in the cockpit will be referred to by number. “COMM 1” references the aircraft’s physical number 1 radio. “COMM 2” references the aircraft’s physical number 2 radio. “COMM 3,” if applicable, references the aircraft’s physical number 3 radio. For all communications following the check-in, each aircraft commander and/or the flight leader may reference frequency switches by color, net, or radio number.2. Turn-up . Aircraft turn-up with position lights on flashing bright and anti-collision lights on (daytime operations), or with position lights flashing dim and anti-collision lights on (night operations). In theater, particularly if operating from an austere site, anti-collision lights may be secured or set to IR during start-up, commensurate with the threat. Complete panel checks and acquire ATIS information prior to the RIO, or as required. 3. Check-in procedures . At the designated time, the flight leader initiates the RIO IAW with the table on the next page. The term “CLEAR” indicates plain text unsecure communication; “SECURE” indicates encrypted communication; and “GO ACTIVE” refers to HAVEQUICK/SINCGARS transmissions.A. All players shall monitor the two single-channel plain text frequencies designated for the check-in on COMM 1, COMM 2, and COMM 3, if appropriate, prior to the designated check-in time. In the event of a lost player during the check-in, the flight lead reestablishes comms with that player on one of these single-channel plain text frequencies.B. If comms are not made during secure or active checks after 10 seconds, switch back to the single channel plain text frequency. Lead shall report only exceptions to the flight (e.g., “RAMPAGE 30 AND 35 NO JOY COMM 2 SECURE”).C. If secure checks are unsuccessful and secure comms are required, have KYs loaded with current fills and reattempt secure checks prior to departure.D. If active checks are unsuccessful on the ground, reattempt once airborne at
