Other squadron commanders act as supporting commanders. The mission commander provides the AMC and is responsible for the execution of the mission; it is imperative that the MAG commander delineates clear command relationships to ensure a coherent command structure. Similarly, in the case of a mission involving multi-group operations, clear command relationships between groups must be set at the MAW level. Establishing command relationships early is critical to create a foundation for the planning and decision-making process. Two separate situations may exist at the MAG level and above. In the first case, the ACE is tasked as a MAGTF supporting effort. In this case, the mission commander is identified from the MAGTF’s main effort. The MAG commanding officer designates an air mission commander from within the ACE to support the mission commander. All squadron commanders support the AMC. In the second case, the ACE is identified as the MAGTF’s main effort. The ACE commander designates a mission commander who has authority over the ACE and any additional supporting units. The AMC is also identified within the ACE and retains authority over supporting squadron commanders. In all cases, delegation of authority comes from the mission commander.STANDARDIZATIONIn addition to the standard military symbols found in MIL-STD-2525D, Operational Terms and Graphics, the following naming conventions are the standard. Mission Planning Tools contain sample lists to facilitate planning.NOTEDeviations from standard conventions may be used for specific areas / theaters. The area / theater-specific conventions should be as standardized as possible.1. Mission-specific routes: Named after states.2. Checkpoints: Named after cities in the selected state-named route. Depicted with a circle.3. Landing Zones (LZ): Named after birds. Depicted with a triangle. Landing zones should be named with reference to their compass direction from the objective. LZs to the north will begin with the letter “N,” those to the east with “E,” and so forth. Dedicated casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) LZs will begin with the letter “C.” Refrain from naming LZs using numbers (e.g., “Egret 1” and “Egret 2”), as this can
