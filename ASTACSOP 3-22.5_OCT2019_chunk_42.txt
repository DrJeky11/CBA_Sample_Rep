VMC can be re-established.ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS:1. Identify unique hazards not previously discussed (e.g. bird migratory activity, seasonal mating behaviors, and seasonal weather patterns such as fog).2. Ensure that all units have a time-hack from the same source. 3. Coordinate with S-2 and S-3 to verify that each essential element of information has been addressed.4. Establish a debrief time and location and ensure S-2 and all aircrews attend.COMMAND AND SIGNAL:1. Identify controlling agencies:A. Identify call signs and capabilities (e.g.,radar, frequency hopping, and radio relay). B. Identify primary and alternate frequencies, as well as secure and clear frequencies for each unit.2. Consult the ACEOI / AKAC for a complete list of frequencies that are required or have the possibility of being utilized.3. Ensure appropriate frequency loads and KY fills have been installed: Crypto rollover (as required).4. EMCON conditions: Determine the criteria that determine the EMCON condition and who establishes it.5. Abort criteria:A. Determine who establishes the abort criteria.B. Identify who has the authority to call mission abort.6. Identify aircraft / ground signals to include GCE pyrotechnics and IR pointers.

Communication should be kept to a minimum by using brevity codes whenever possible. Should the flight encounter an unbriefed situation, the flight leader should not hesitate to brief the flight over the inter / intra-flight frequency as appropriate. The following standards apply:A. Secure communications / Communication Security (COMMSEC). Use secure comms to pass sensitive information using plain language. If secure comms are unsuccessful upon initial RIO and secure comms are required as mission-essential equipment or for mission go criteria, troubleshoot and re-load radio secure fills prior to departure and/or re-attempt secure comms checks at an appropriate point (e.g., “FENCE-IN” point).B. Active communications / Transmission Security (TRANSEC). Use frequency-agile comms whenever possible. Initiate anti-jam operations at an appropriate point, with the use of the proword “ACTIVE” (e.g., “ELVIS 21 FLIGHT, GO [ACTIVE OR COLOR] CHARLIE 1”). (1) WARNING: Active communications alone do not protect information from being compromised. Utilize RAMROD/code words rather than plain language to pass sensitive information over a plain text net.C. Frequency changes. All frequency changes that are not automatic are a positive switch with a “front side” check: “CUTTER 21 FLIGHT, SWITCH BLUE, CHARLIE 2.” “CUTTER TWO-TWO,” “CUTTER TWO-THREE...” Check in. When checking in with the appropriate Aviation Command and Control (AC2) agency, the flight lead or designated aircraft checks in with the flight call sign, mission number, position, and flight status (“as fragged” or “with exceptions”) and requests an update on the friendly and threat situation. When checking out with the AC2agency, provide a MISREP.AUTHENTICATION AND ENCIPHERING.1. Authentication . Authentication will be accomplished when working clear frequencies on first contact with a controlling or supporting agency / flight. Aircrew authenticating an agency
