Hostile aircraft outside 5 nm of the assault package:(1) FW escorts may engage hostile aircraft IAW ROE. (2) FW escorts reports “COMMIT” with a bullseye call or Bearing Altitude Aspect (BRAA) call. This is typically made over the AC2 net monitored by the assault package.(A) “Razor 1 commit pop-up group, bullseye 134 / 47.” (B) “Razor 1 commit pop-up group, BRAA 090 / 35 / 1200.(3) FW escorts report “TARGETED” with radar / sensor SA to the threat. Expect the FW escorts to engage the hostile aircraft after this call.(A) “Razor 1 targeted pop-up group.”(4) FW escorts determine that the hostile aircraft has closed within a predetermined distance to the assault package, FW escorts may direct the assault package to “SPIN” or “LEAN.”(A) A “LEAN” call from FW escorts is directive for the assault package to turn 45 deg away from the planned route / course.(i) “Rampage 31, lean west.”(B) A “SPIN” call from FW escorts is directive for the assault package to execute 4 min of holding at the package’s current position or a specified point. (i) “Rampage 31, spin.”(5) FW escorts determine that the hostile aircraft was able to bypass the escorts or reach a pre-determined threat range, FW escorts should direct the assault package to “SCRAM.”(A) “Rampage 31, leakers, leakers, scram. Bullseye 134 / 47”B. Hostile aircraft within 5 nm of the assault package(1) FW escorts may engage with VID of the assault package and a clear avenue of fire. (A) The escorted package should have already received a “SCRAM” call from the FW escorts if the hostile aircraft is within 5 nm of the assault package.C. Hostile aircraft within 2 nm of the assault package:(1) If FW and RW escorts are part of the escort package, expect a handoff of the hostile aircraft to the RW escorts.(2) Assault package executes scatter plan.(3) FW escort disengages and passes hostile aircraft position to RW escort.(4) RW escort engages with VID of the assault package.D. Hostile aircraft within 500 meters of assault package: (1) Assault aircraft engage with VID of RW escorts; RW escorts engage with VID of assault package. (A) If no RW escorts are available, expect FW escorts to hand off the threat directly to the assault package for self-defense.NTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 128 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUONOTEBrevity terms “COMMIT, TARGETED, SPIN, LEAN, SCRAM, LEAKER” can be found in the MCRP 3-30B.1 Joint Brevity MTTP.SCATTER PLANScatter plans are executed with the proword “BEEHIVE” and are based on the need to counter a threat.
