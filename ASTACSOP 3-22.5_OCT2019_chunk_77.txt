NAVAIR publications can be found at the Airworthiness website: https://airworthiness.navair.navy.milROTARY-WING/TILTROTOR ADGR AND FARP OPERATIONS1. There are two categories of FARPs: Assault and static. For amplifying and most current information, see reference (C). These are the two common fuel delivery methods: A. Aviation Ground Support (AGS) using tactical fuel systems.B. Aviation Delivered Ground Refueling (ADGR) using aircraft-specific refueling systems on board the KC-130, CH-53, and MV-22. 2. FARP fueling points are normally linear and numbered (1, 2, 3, â€¦) north to south or west to east. Laager points are represented by letters (A-Z) in the same manner (N-S, W-E).A. Assault FARP operations. Assault FARPS use pre-stage, fueling, and post-stage areas regardless of the refueling asset used to support the FARP. Taxi directors may guide aircraft into the fueling area as required. See the ASSAULT FARP figure.(1) Assault FARP sequence of events: (A) Aircraft approach FARP, establish comms, follow entry procedures and land in the pre-stage area. (B) Aircraft weapons and expendable buckets are de-armed. Aircraft coordinates movement into the fueling area with FARP OIC.(C) Aircraft taxi to fueling point, guided by a taxi director, if required. Aircraft shall not taxi past another aircraft in the fueling area. Aircraft shall debark troops at fuel points prior to refueling.(D) Aircraft are refueled. Aircraft embark troops at fuel points post refueling.(E) Aircraft taxi to post-stage area and are loaded and armed.(F) Aircraft depart the FARP via established exit procedures.NTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 166 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO(G) Loading of ordnance shall be accomplished in the post-stage only.(H) Movement within the FARP:(i) Aircraft shall ensure anti-collision lights (day) or IR anti-collision lights/IR ring lights (night operations) are turned on when moving within the FARP. Use of overt / covert lighting must be coordinated between aircrew and FARP personnel, based on environmental conditions and night vision goggle availability of FARP personnel. At all other times, anti-collision lights will be off.(ii) When air taxi is required for movement within the FARP, only one aircraft is allowed to move at a time.(iii) If ground taxi is permissible, multiple aircraft may taxi within the pre-stage and post-stage areas at the same time. Multiple aircraft may taxi within the refueling area if under the control of a taxi director.(I) (I) In case of a malfunction (e.g., jammed gun), the aircraft with the malfunction shall coordinate with the FARP OIC (via controlling agency, as appropriate) for landing clearance to
