or “Land to the Y”Assault support aircraft land 300 to 1,000 meters from the target or objective. Because the aircraft will be landing on the edge of small arms range, additional coordination with CAS and ISR aircraft must be conducted. As with “Landing to the X,” the Assault Flight Lead reserves the right to define what those specific support requirements will be, and should take into account the max ranges of enemy weapons systems that can affect the zone. Additional considerations include the exposure of the GCE to the threat during an extended ground movement to the objective.Offset or “Land to the Offset”Defined as landing at distances of 1,000 meters or greater from the target or objective or outside of audible detection. Recommended in non-permissive areas where participating aircraft and/or ground forces are unable to mitigate threat, or ground forces desire to infiltrate without being detected.Anytime that assault support aircraft are landing within range of enemy direct or indirect fire assets, consideration should be given to the use of multiple landing zones, with smaller flight elements per zone. Use of multiple LZ’s increases survivability by providing dispersion and increasing speed in/out of the LZ. The AFC and AFL must balance this with the GCE SOM/echelon plan and ability to mass combat power. Flight divergence inside the IP will increase complexity and require detailed planning for ingress, escort, wave-offs, and rejoins/egress.
