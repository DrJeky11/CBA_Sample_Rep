This template is derived from Joint PR doctrine and is standard for USMC assets. RMC’s should strive to accomplish the tasks listed in the order they are provided.NOTEJoint Doctrine references the term “AMC” to describe Air Mission Coordinator, which is not a USMC qualification and therefore omitted from the template. When there is no dedicated RMC, the RESCORT should assume the RMC responsibilities, unless otherwise coordinated.TRAP Execution TemplateTask ActionRouting/Safety of Flight RMC approves incoming asset into the airspace and established de-confliction.Aircraft Check In RMC will receive new aircraft’s check in.Situation Update (RMC provide new asset with the situation update.Game plan After initial roll call and threat low down, RMC provide assets with RV route selection and SEAD/strike tasking.PR 15-line Review/Remarks RMC review PR 15-line with RV and RESCORT prior to execution.Execute Recovery RMC, RESCORT, and RV will execute the recovery of the isolated personnel IAW PR 15-line and game plan.Assets not involved with the primary execution will continue their previous tasks IAW with the RMCs game plan.Egress Isolated Personnel OBJ Area Post “Popcorn + X”, RMC, RESCORT, and RV begin egress IAW with PR 15-line and game plan.Assets not involved with the primary execution begin to egress once Recovery assets are no longer vulnerable.Routing/Safety of Flight RMC approve assets RTB via best MRR (minimum risk routing). On Scene Commander (OSC) responsibilities. In general, the first aircraft on station assumes the role of OSC. Reference the OSC Checklist on the last page of this publication. Depending on the capabilities of the OSC, including playtime, the initial OSC may be relieved by a more capable platform. As the responsibilities of OSC turnover, it is imperative that the information gathered is appropriately passed to subsequent OSC’s and / or the RMC.Trap Aircraft Check-InThe RMC should receive assets’ check-ins using the standard aircraft check-in and provide pertinent information using the situation update shown below. The check-in and situation update should be passed on a TRAP / SAR common net. Fires should be planned
