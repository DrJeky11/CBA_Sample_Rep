plain text can be mixed with cipher text. The words “I SET” must precede the enciphered message. This indicates to the recipient that the next three letters are the random set indicator. Use pauses to indicate the space between the set indicator, grid zone designator (if needed), and enciphered numbers.EXAMPLE“METAL 41, THIS IS BROADSWORD 16, I SET PRK. MY GRID ZONE DESIGNATOR AND LOCATION IS JB YTW MPE”To decipher numbers . After receiving the enciphered message, identify the random set indicator. These are the first three letters of the cipher text following the words “I SET.” Determine the appropriate decipher row, using the procedures listed above. Using this decipher row, read right on the row until you locate the first letter of cipher text. Determine which number appears at the top of that column. Substitute that column number for the cipher text letter. This number is the first digit of the plain text message. Remain on that row and repeat this process for each letter of cipher text.To decipher grid zone designators . After determining the decipher row, read right on that row until you locate the cipher text letter. Substitute the cipher text letter with the plain text letter located directly above it on the darker printed guide alphabet. Repeat for the last letter of the grid zone designator.NOTEUnless given specific instructions, never assume that a grid zone designator has been transmitted.NTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 196 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUOCHALLENGE AND REPLY (AUTHENTICATION).1. To challenge . Select three letters at random. The first letter shall not be “A” (this letter is reserved for the TRIAD Airborne Matrix).Use the procedure described in the next step to determine the correct response to your challenge. NOTERandom selection is essential for security reasons: do not repeat challenges and do not use standard groups such as ““XYZ,” “YYY,” etc. 2. To reply . Using the three letters transmitted in the challenge, take the first letter and go to the line indicated by that letter. (Rows are indicated by the far left single column of letters in bold print.) Move to the right on that row until you reach the second letter of the challenge. Take the letter directly BELOW the second letter of the challenge and go to the row indicated by that letter. Move to the right on that row until you reach the third letter of the challenge, the letter directly below the third letter is the correct reply.NOTEIf directed to go to a letter below the Zulu row, choose the letter from the same column on the Alpha row.EXAMPLEIf you were challenged with the letters “FSX” , your reply should be “V”.1st Ltr 2nd Ltr0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9F AVRC ULF XHJ SQK DO PMN WZ GE YB TIG PHWG DUO QVL KRN AJ MCS FI EX TY BZ3rd LtrK KPXU VJF HIM LGR AB DCT WE QY NZ SOL JUVZ LPG BDW STR MQ AFH XE OC IY NKEXAMPLE“BROADSWORD 16 THIS IS METAL 41, REQUEST YOU AUTHENTICATE
