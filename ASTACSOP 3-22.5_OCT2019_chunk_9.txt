streamlined RFI process is critical to developing a sound tactical plan and will enhance planning efficiency. RULES OF ENGAGEMENTRules of Engagement (ROE) will be considered during problem framing. A requirement for supplemental ROE may be identified during detailed planning. These requirements should be requested early.GROUND TACTICAL PLANBefore an air assault operation can be planned, the ground scheme of maneuver must be finalized. It is the foundation of a successful air assault operation.1. GCE MissionA. Air Assault Task Force MissionB. Commander’s IntentC. ObjectivesD. General Scheme of ManeuverE.
