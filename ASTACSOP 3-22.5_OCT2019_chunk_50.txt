arming / de-arming is complete, the dash last aircraft turns anti-collision lights on with navigation/IR position light set as briefed, rippling to the lead aircraft. When arming night, after the initial ripple of anti-collision lights, lead turns off his anti-collision light, rippled back to the last aircraft. The dash last aircraft (maximum of four) keep anti-collision and navigation lights on (CNAF 3710/FAA regulations apply during training/peacetime operations). At the completion of the lighting sequence, the flight automatically switches to controlling agency. During contingency operations, when visual lighting may be prohibited, substitute radio calls or other suitable visual signal (e.g., chemlights) to inform the lead the flight is ready to launch.MACO AIRCRAFT MARKINGSMark aircraft with Arabic numbers in the windows using white reflective / duct tape. For NVG operations, white reflective / duct tape is easily visible through NVDs. An alternative to white reflective / duct tape are chemical light sticks. However, a plan needs to be developed and briefed to both aircrew and assault force on chemical light stick markings / interpretation.
