documents not required for evasion.4. Remove / disable aircraft weapons.5. Establish security / defensive position.6. Prepare LZ for pick-up (ITG as required / directed by OSC). If possible, position adjacent to an area suitable for RW / TR to land. Otherwise, a hoist pick-up will be required. E&E IAW EPA.7. Any of the methods described below may be used to report downed aircraft:A. MGRS or LAT / LONG.B. Bullseye . The bullseye method designates a location in range and bearing FROM designated checkpoint.C. The method of location reporting in SAR is range and bearing TO the SARDOT. UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 155TRAPNTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO8. Survival radio is the primary signaling / communications device for both day and night. Follow these steps: A. Turn on radio and execute immediate action procedures using over-the-horizon communications or other secure methods to notify higher authority of the downed aircraft.B. Always assume the enemy can hear the transmissions and may have DF capability. Use short transmissions, pass only essential information, and use code words as much as possible to minimize the information compromised. Limit transmissions to 5 seconds or less to degrade DF capability.C. If friendly aircraft are observed in the area (e.g., wingman), attempt comms on SAR A using tactical call sign (e.g., “ RESCUE, THIS IS METAL 41 ”). If no joy on SAR A, then attempt comms on SAR B. (1) If no contact is made on SAR A or B, attempt contact on 243.0 and then 282.8. Listen for 1 minute; repeat two more times, if necessary. If comms are not established, secure the radio.(2) Subsequent check-in attempts should be made on SAR A every hour on the hour. If the crew is still together, balance the use of their radios to avoid using all battery life at the same time and causing confusion with agencies on the number and location of personnel. SAMPLE TRAP PACKAGESThe following table serves as an example for pre-planned TRAP packages. Planners should develop mission packages with considerations for the assets’ range, threat, capacity, and configuration. Plan for special equipment for recovery, such as installation of hoist or refueling capability.
