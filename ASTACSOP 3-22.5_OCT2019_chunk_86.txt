It is given in WEIGHT and not number of personnel.Air Weapons Team (AWT) Any rotary-wing aviation fires asset in direct or dedicated support of an assault support mission.Ground Assault Force (GAF) Similar to a HAF, but insertion takes place via vehicles or on foot.Helicopter Assault Force (HAF) A task organization in which helicopters, their support units, and troop units are combined for helicopter-borne assault missions.Kicker Pallet/Speedball A pre-loaded, pre-staged, and marked container of ammunition /medical supplies/chow or water.
