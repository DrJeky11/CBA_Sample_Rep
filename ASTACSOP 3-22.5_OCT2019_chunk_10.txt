Execution ChecklistLANDING PLANThe landing plan is designed to support the ground tactical plan. It contains the details of how the assault force is inserted and extracted, what fires support the insert and extract, and the command and control procedures for the assault. The number and type of aircraft and landing zones available affect the speed of combat build-up in the objective area.1. Mission Assets—Location / Routing / TOSA. OASB. AssaultsC. C2D. EWE.
