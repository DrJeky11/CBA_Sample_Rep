SPARROW, WREN”5. Continue / Hold CallA. The assault flight does not proceed beyond the IP until receiving approval from the EFL. This call indicates that the LZ(s) criteria is still met and escorts are in position per the brief. Additionally, escorts provide amplifying remarks by exception to build assault flight SA. If the assault flight does not receive a “CONTINUE” call by the IP, proceed to a pre-planned or hasty HA and hold.(1) “RAMPAGE 31 CONTINUE; VENOM 11 ESTABLISHED SNAKE” (plus amplifying remarks by exception)(2) “RAMPAGE 31 HOLD (LOCATION); VENOM 11 ESTABLISHED SNAKE” (plus amplifying remarks by exception)B.

The standard for ITG is to coordinate with the GCE (or other assets, including aviation) for far and near signals. Radio comms should be used to augment ITG.A. Far ITG used to orient the flight to the general location of the LZ (e.g., IR sparkle, signal mirror). (1) If IR Sparkle is used for far ITG, joint IR brevity shall be used (reference Joint CAS JP3-09.3).B. Near ITG used to mark the specific landing site or point (e.g., Smoke, IR buzzsaw, desert box).NTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 138 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO2. OBJ AREA FIRES A. Weapons Conditions(1) The MCRP 3-30B.1 (ALSA Brevity MTTP) defines weapons FREE / TIGHT / HOLD. These conditions are based on current ROE and enemy situation. Typically, one weapon’s condition applies for the entirety of a mission. Weapon’s conditions cover when to shoot, not where to shoot. (2) During the conduct of an air assault, friendly force disposition and location change, however weapons conditions typically remain the same if ROE remains the same. Weapons conditions should not change between waves of assaults. B. Sectors of fire (1) Sectors of fire are anchored on the landing zone. (2) The AFL, EFL and AFC
