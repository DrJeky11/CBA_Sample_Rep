and CDE and pass additional restrictions to all assets, as required, for weapons employment within the RFA.B. TRAP ROZ : Surface to 35,000 feet MSL, 10 nm radius around isolated personnel. ROZ size can be adjusted as required however, 10 nm offers enough space within the ROZ to hold FW aircraft within the protected airspace.C. Recovery Vehicle (RV) : Low ≤ 300 feet AGL; RV High 9,000–13,000 feet MSL. NLT IP (5 nm entry into the ROZ), the RV will be ≤ 300 feet AGL. Distance can vary but, at a minimum, planners must allow 1 nm from the initial point (IP) for every 1,000 feet AGL that an MV-22 must descend.D. RV HA : ≤ 300 feet AGL, 5–7 nm from isolated personnel location. Both the HA and Initial Point are designed to shift relative to the threat and should be on the opposite side of the threat and isolated personnel. Unless defined by a CP or other easily identifiable terrain feature, the HA will be 5nm and a magnetic radial from the survivor NTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 146 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUOlocation (e.g., HA SE is 135 degrees magnetic and 5nm from the isolated personnel position).E. RW RESCORT : 500–2,000 feet AGL. (1) BP Overhead: 1,000 m radius overhead isolated personnel location, 500–2,000 feet AGL.(2) Hasty BP/HA can be created using the keyhole template (see below).F. FW RESCORT : Low 3,000–8,000 feet MSL; High 14,000–21,000 feet MSL. G. SEAD : 22,000–28,000 feet MSL.H. RESCAP : 29,000–31,000 feet MSL.I. KEYHOLE TEMPLATE OVERLAY : The keyhole template is an efficient method for establishing an IP in the absence of control points or when control points do not support the mission. When using the keyhole template, distance represents nautical miles for FW/TR aircraft and kilometers for RW CAS aircraft from the echo point. 1. For RW CAS assets, the direction / distance provided will determine the center grid for a standard 2 x 2 km HA / BP. Non-standard dimensions can be used and specified (e.g., “VENOM 11 hold DELTA 5 at angels 2 and below ” or “ DEUCE 23 hold CHARLIE 5, center grid 3 x 3 at Cherubs 5 and below ”.2. The echo point should be the location of the isolated personnel (line 3 of the PR 15-line) and shall be updated as required prior to execution.
