the world into 30-minute by 30-minute cells. Each of these cells is subsequently divided into four 15-minute by 15-minute quadrants, and then broken down further into nine 5-minute by 5-minute keypads. The GARS-defined cells are not FSCMs, ACMs, or maneuver control measures, but simply a common reference system across all AORs that complement joint fire support and/or airspace control systems and measures.NTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 112 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUOGLOBAL AREA REFERENCE SYSTEMEMCON PROCEDURESEMCON procedures can be found in the appropriate OPORD or theater SPINS. For AAR operations, reference NATO Publication ATP 3.3.4.2. EMCON procedures should be briefed in the Command and Signal portion of the mission/flight brief. For example, if executing a mission under EMCON Level One conditions, it would be briefed as “EMCON Level One.” The following is meant to define EMCON procedures during training missions or operational missions when not designated in higher directives.1. Level One . Electronic Warfare Support (ES) threat is negligible, as compared to the fire power threat to survival. Only essential radio transmissions are made and aircraft emitters to be used as required.2. Level Two . The majority of tactical missions are flown under this condition. A serious ES threat exists; takeoffs and landings use MINCOM procedures. Operate radios at a bare minimum and use brevity codes to reduce transmission time. All other emitters may be used.3. Level Three . The most restrictive condition and is used when a serious ES threat exists. Electronic emissions are prohibited, including radios, DME, and IFF / SIF (except required mode 4 / 5 in theater). Radar altimeters are permitted if listed as required equipment under NATOPS or for safety of flight. Takeoffs and landings use EMCON procedures. Communications with controlling agencies shall be made by ground observers or Airboss via landline to report departure times and numbers. During training evolutions, radio communications are permitted for safety-of-flight items only.AHAG006AG4321987654321A Quadrant can befurther sub-dividedinto nine 5 min x 5 minkeypads006AG3006AG39AFAEADACABAA009 008 007 006 005 004 003 002 001Origin PointSouth Pole / 180 E/WEach cell issub-divided into four15 min x 15 min Quadrants UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 113GRND OPSNTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUOGROUND OPERATIONSAIRCRAFT AND PERSONAL EQUIPMENT AND PREPARATION1.
