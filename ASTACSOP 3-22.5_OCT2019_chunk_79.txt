COLD points, aircraft restart engines. Aircraft are rearmed.(E) Aircraft depart the FARP via established exit procedures.(F) In case of a malfunction (e.g., jammed gun), the aircraft with the malfunction shall coordinate with FARP OIC (via controlling agency, as appropriate) for landing clearance. Once on deck, the malfunction must be cleared prior to fuel / ordnance servicing.NOTEThe UH-1Y refueling port is on the left side of the aircraft. AH-1 refueling ports are on the right side of the aircraft.NOTEAircraft lands and takes off into the wind to the maximum extent practical. Inbound aircraft should avoid overflight of aircraft, ground equipment, ordnance, and FARP personal while adhering to the ingress and arm/de-arm headings.

KC-130. Refueling procedures are the same as the assault FARP. The KC-130 should be positioned with access to the runway in the event an immediate egress is required while conducting refueling operations. See the KC-130 figure.D. CH-53 / MV-22. ADGR operations can be conducted by following the procedures for a static or assault FARP. In order to provide the minimum of 300 feet separation between an aircraft being refueled and an aircraft being uploaded with ordnance, it is recommended that the CH-53s / MV 22s be 400 feet apart, in accordance with the figure. This allows for refueling to occur at two of the points while uploading of ordnance is being conducted at the other two points. In the event of a single aircraft FARP, refueling and uploading of ordnance may not occur simultaneously but may be conducted at the refueling points.FARP / ADGR COMMUNICATION1. Comms with the aircrew and between ground personnel is required. The site should be equipped with both UHF and VHF radios. A common ground safety frequency should link ground support personnel. Radio transmissions should be minimized during de-arming, refueling, and arming.NVD COMPATABLE LIGHTMANIFOLDORDNANCE PRE-STAGE AREAWAVE OFF150’80’150’REFUEL NOZZLELEGENDPANEL MARKERWARNING:PERSONNEL MUST REMAIN COGNIZANT OF TAIL ROTORSDURING HOT REFUELINGNOTE:THE AMBIDEXTROUS SETUP WILL ALLOW REFUELING WITHOUT THEREQUIREMENT TO ASSIGN REFUELING POINT TO AIRCRAFT BASED ONTYPE / MODEL / SERIESSTATIC FARP HOT POINTS UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 173NTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUOFARP OPS2.
