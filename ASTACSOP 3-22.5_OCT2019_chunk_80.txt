Safety-of-flight calls are made as required. In the event ATC / MMT supports the site, ATC / MMT provide aircraft approach, landing, and departure control. The Air Boss, site OIC and EFR monitor the ATC / MMT frequency and pass information for aircraft in flight through the ATC / MMT to prevent unnecessary frequency switching by aircraft during flight.5. Once on the deck or in the pre-stage area, aircraft switch to the Air Boss or VHF ground safety frequency. When departing, aircraft notify the Air Boss / OIC prior to switching to the ATC / MMT frequency.6. Air Boss Procedures: An OIC / Air Boss have a working knowledge of the Marine Aviation Command and Control System (MACCS) sufficient to allow deconfliction and aircraft control in and around the site, establish priority of support within the site based on mission requirements, and provide transitioning pilots with situational updates as required.A. General. The Air Boss serves as a MACCS node, operates in the site, and maintains SA for the TACC during operations. During operations with multiple sites, an Air Boss shall be located at each site (or at least where no DASC is present).B. Flight leaders. All flight leaders shall check in and out with the Air Boss. Flight leaders shall provide at a minimum: (1). Call sign (2). Mission and status (3). Applicable threat information (4). Friendly situation updates (5). Any other pertinent info (BDA, follow-on intentions)EMERGENCY PROCEDURESThe following procedures delineate the immediate response for an emergency involving an aircraft fire or attack during refueling:1. Fire emergency procedures.A. FARP / ADGR crew. In case of fire or emergencies that could lead to a fire, members of the crew should:(1) Stopfuelflow. Close nozzles, close the valves in the refueling system, and uncouple the hose lines from all aircraft (if possible).(2) Free the aircraft. If possible, separate aircraft being refueled from the fuel lines. Disconnect the nozzles and grounding wires so aircraft can get clear of the danger area, if necessary.150FT300 FT - 500 FT300 FT150FTCH-53 / MV-22 ADGR UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 175NTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUOFARP OPS(3) Give the alarm. Give the alarm by using the established emergency procedures at the refueling point. Any person can direct approaching aircraft away from the danger and, if necessary, can direct aircraft on the ground to move in a safe and orderly manner.(4) Attempttorescueaircrewandcontainfire.
