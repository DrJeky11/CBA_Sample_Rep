extract – The key difference between an emergency extract while conducting VBSS and a land-based mission is that aircraft inserting the raid force is not likely capable of landing for pick-up. If the CCOI is rigged to explode or an overwhelming force is present, the raid force may elect to jump off the side of the ship. Either a surface asset or an air asset capable of rapidly deploying rafts may be necessary to facilitate emergency extract of the raid force.VBSS SAMPLE TEMPLATEVBSS templates must be planned and rehearsed prior to execution and should not be conducted without prior training and coordination. All examples below should be considered a guide only and deviations if necessary and expected based on individual missions .

If the TRAP is dedicated, crews should have recovery kits, tools, and combat gear ready, and there should be a crew designated and briefed as the TRAP aircrew. Listed below are the references for the conduct of TRAP. 1. ALSA MTTP Personnel Recovery (PR) , USMC Designation MCRP 3-05.32. JP 3-50 Personnel Recovery NOTEThe procedures in this chapter provide standards in the absence of theater procedures, but are superseded by such theater procedures, if they exist.EVASION PLAN OF ACTION (EPA)All aircrew shall complete and submit an EPA to the S-2 IAW theater SPINS. ISOPREP data is stored at the Personnel Recovery Coordination Cell (PRCC) level and squadron access is available via Personnel Recovery Mission Software (PRMS), typically through the S-2.TRAP LAUNCH CRITERIAListed below are the desired minimum criteria to launch a TRAP; however, aircrews must remain flexible. A competent authority may require additional launch criteria but, given the time critical nature of TRAP operations, the TACC, MAGTF commander, or other competent authority (e.g., JPRC) may order a launch without each criterion being met.1. There should be a reasonable certainty that isolated personnel are alive.2. The location of the personnel, equipment, or aircraft must be known.TRAP TEMPLATEThe TRAP template is designed for a deliberate TRAP where ACMs do not exist to support the recovery mission. Adjust the template as required to meet the specific mission. The template altitudes are based upon the isolated personnel being at sea level and require altitude adjustments as the elevation increases. A. RFA 1 : 500m radius from survivor. Requires positive communication with (or VID of) downed personnel prior to ordnance delivery (or the effects of ordnance) within the RFA. The RMC/RESCORT should provide additional mitigation measures to minimize fratricide
