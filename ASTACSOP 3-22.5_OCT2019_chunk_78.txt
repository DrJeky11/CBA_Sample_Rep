Once cleared, the aircraft departs the FARP as necessary to re-enter via the pre-stage area.ASSAULT FARP 150’ 300’ - 500’ 300’ - 500’40’20’200’150’150’150’* NOT TO SCALEREFUELINGAREAPRE-STAGEAREAPOST-STAGEAREAMK970 REFUELER /7 TON TRUCK WITHHERS BLADDERS /LVS WITH BEACONWAVEOFFPOSITION LIGHTPANEL MARKERREFUEL NOZZLELEGENDFOUR POINT HOTREFUELING FARP FORASSAULT HELICOPTERS UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 167NTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUOFARP OPS35 FEET12 FEET18 FEETSANDBAGWITH LIGHT12 FEET18 FEET35 FEETFUELPOINTPANELMARKER150 FEET BETWEEN CENTER OF EACH BULLET BOX150 FEET BETWEEN FUEL POINTS80’ FROM PANEL MARKER OF EACH BULLET STAR TO FUEL POINT35 FEET12 FEET18 FEETSANDBAGWITH LIGHT12 FEET18 FEET35 FEETFUELPOINTPANELMARKERMAWTS-1 AGS BULLET BOXNTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 168 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUOAH-1 SCALE “Y” BULLET TRAPAH-1 SCALE BULLET BOX AH-1 SCALE “Y” BULLET TRAP48 FT13 FT 4 IN13 FT 4 IN2 FT 1 IN2 FT 1 IN12 FT16 FT24 FT5 FT7FT3 IN2 FT 8 IN12 FT12 FT6 FT48 FT35 FTSANDBAGWITH LIGHTPANELMARKER28 FT2 FT 8 IN18 FT35 FT5 FT7FT3 IN12 FTAH-1 SCALE BULLET BOX UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 169NTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUOFARP OPSUH-1 SCALE BULLET BOX UH-1 SCALE “Y” BULLET TRAP48 FT13 FT 4 IN2 FT 1 IN2 FT 1 IN12 FT16 FT24 FT5 FT7FT3 IN2 FT 8 IN12 FT12 FT6 FT48 FT35 FTSANDBAGWITH LIGHTPANELMARKER28 FT2 FT 8 IN18 FT35 FT5 FT7FT3 IN12 FT13 FT 4 INUH-1 SCALE “Y” BULLET TRAP UH-1 SCALE BULLET BOXNTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 170 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUOB. Static FARP operations. The static FARP is normally used by attack and utility aircraft that land at a single point and fuel / ordnance services come to the aircraft. The points at a static FARP can either be HOT or COLD. At COLD points de-arming / arming, upload / download of ordnance, and fuel operations are conducted as separate evolutions with the rotors stopped. The distance between COLD re-fueling points should be 150 feet, but no less than 100 feet if terrain or FARP dimensions dictate. At HOT points, aircraft are not required to shut down. See reference (B) and (C) for authorized distances between hot refueling and hot tube loading operations. Static FARPs may also have laager points adjacent to HOT and COLD points where aircraft may be used for maintenance or delays. See the static FARP figure.(1) Static FARP sequence of events:(A) Aircraft approach FARP, establish comms, follow entry procedures, and land at designated points.(B) Aircraft are de-armed. At COLD points, aircraft shut down, APU may be running regardless of T / M / S and ordnance configuration.(C) Aircraft refuels and has ordnance loaded, as required. A designated member of the flight coordinates with the FARP team to determine the sequence of replenishment (fuel or ordnance) based on the requirements.NOTEFor current authorization of simultaneous refueling and ordnance loading on a single aircraft, see references (B) and (C). During AH-1 hot-fueling operations, a pilot is required to exit the aircraft to assist in connecting the fuel nozzle to the aircraft and to conduct fueling checks IAW the AH-1 NATOPS, it is common for AH-1 pilots to stand in a position to communicate with the pilot remaining in the aircraft.(D) At
