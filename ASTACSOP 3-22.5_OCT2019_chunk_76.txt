Composition B. Location (1) Co-located with DASC, TAOC, LFOCEXECUTION CONSIDERATIONSEvery CASEVAC mission will be different, crews should strive to be as flexible as possible for the conditions met during CASEVAC. The number one priority should remain on safely extracting the casualty and moving them to follow-on care as expeditiously as possible. The following considerations can be applied depending on actual conditions, medical team preferences:1. HLZ Selection. Due to the unplanned nature of CASEVAC, HLZs are typically selected by the JTAC on the ground in the form of an “HLZ Black” when pre-planned HLZs are not suitable due to mission constraints (patient mobility, enemy and threats, etc.). The primary method of HLZ brief from the JTAC to CASEVAC platform is the “9-Line CASEVAC Brief” located in MCRP 3-16.6A: UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 163NTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUOCASEVACMEDEVAC or CASEVAC BriefLine Item Explanation1 Location (using the military grid reference system)2 Call Sign and HLZ Frequency Call sign and suffix may be transmitted in the clear3 Number and Precedence of Casualties A – Urgent B – Urgent Surgical C - Priority D – Routine E - Convenience4 Special Equipment Required A – None B – Hoist C – Extraction equipment D – Ventilator Other (Specify5 Number of Casualties by Type L – Litter plus number of casualties A – Ambulatory plus number of casualties6 Security of the HLZ N – No enemy P – Possible enemy in area E – Enemy in area X – Armed escort required7 HLZ Markings A – Panels B – Pyrotechnic signal C – Smoke (color) D – None E – Other (Specify)8 Casualties by Nationality or Status A – U.S. military B – U.S. citizen C – Non-U.S. military D – Non-U.S. citizen E – EPW9 CBRN ContaminationHLZ Terrain and ObstaclesC – Chemical B – Biological R – Radiological N – Nuclear - Description of the zone and any hazards, to include windsMIST Additional information (if time and the situation permit): M – Mechanism of Injury I – Injury S – Signs and symptoms T - TreatmentNTTP 3-22.5-ASTACSOP, October 2019 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 164 UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO2. Cabin Configuration. Teams may use litters with aircraft stanchions or a mobile operating table. Location and number vary with each team. Conduct thorough team briefs as early as possible to establish specific cabin configuration.3. Cabin Lighting. When threat and mission allow, it is recommended that cabin lighting is turned on as soon as possible. White lights are preferred.4. Additional Considerations. At the request of the medical team cockpit aircrew should set environmental control system (ECS) temperature as high as feasible to help regulate patient body temperature. Aircrew and other passengers should be “uncomfortably hot.” Consideration should also be made to closing the cargo ramp and door as soon as situation allows. This will reduce lighting signature as well as help maintain cabin temperature. Crew Chiefs should also be prepared to assist any medical team members as required.
