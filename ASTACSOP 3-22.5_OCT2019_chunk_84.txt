Initial mission planning: The GFC provides the supporting aviation unit with the following information in order to begin the planning process: (1) MGRS grid location of objective(s).(2) MGRS grid locations of enemy threats in the area (updated S-2 picture).(3) MGRS grid location of PZ.(4) Desired infiltration / exfiltration Helicopter Landing Zones (HLZ).(5) General scheme of maneuver.(6) General time line.(7) Minimum ground force required to accomplish the mission.(8) GCE Concept of Operations slides.(9) Fire Support and duration required.(10) Minimum support assets required (ISR, EW, CAS, etc.)B.
